Synapse is a non-intrusive C++ signal programming library for C++11.

Official documentation: https://zajo.github.io/synapse/

Features:

* Any C or {CPP} object of any type whatsoever can be used as a signal emitter.

* A system of meta signals for interoperability with other signal programming libraries and callback APIs. Lambda captures can be easily installed as C API callbacks!

* In a multi-thread environment signals can be emitted asynchronously and scheduled for synchronous execution when polled in other threads.

* No dependencies.

Support is available via:

* [cpplang on Slack](https://Cpplang.slack.com) (use the `#boost` channel)
* [Boost Users Mailing List](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-users)
* [Boost Developers Mailing List](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost)
